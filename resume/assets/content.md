# Introduction

I'm a Seattle native and a professional developer of roughly 9 years.
I got my first job working in web development at 16 years old and have been
refining a portfolio of pragmatic experience within the tech industry ever since.
I specialize in delivering the entire package: consultation, design, engineering,
and smooth deployment to production -- including an infrastructure plan -- all with
clear and transparent communication.
